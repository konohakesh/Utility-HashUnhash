This API can be used to encrypt a file and then decrypt it.
For example, this can be used to encrypt a file that has a lot of your passwords and then at the time of adding\retrieving a password, it can be used to decrypt it.

If you don't want to modify the code, a runnable jar is ready and can be found in 'release' section.

Usage:

To encrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar <path to the file> close


To decrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar <path to the file> open
