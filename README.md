# Utility-HashUnhash

This API can be used to encrypt a file and then decrypt it.
For example, this can be used to encrypt a file that has a lot of your passwords and then at the time of adding\retrieving a password, it can be used to decrypt it.

You can modify it and re-use it for your own purpose. (Probably to change the secret of encyption)
You can also find the executable in 'Release' tab and download the jar to use it directly out of the box.

Usage-

To encrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar path-to-the-file close


To decrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar path-to-the-file open
