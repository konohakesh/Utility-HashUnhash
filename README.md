This API can be used to encrypt a file and then decrypt it.
For example, this can be used to encrypt a file that has a lot of your passwords and then at the time of adding\retrieving a password, it can be used to decrypt it.

You can either modify it and re-use it for your own purpose.
You can also find the executable in 'Release' tab and download the jar to use it directly out of the box.

Usage-

To encrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar path-to-the-file close


To decrypt a file:

HashUnhash.jar path-to-the-file open
